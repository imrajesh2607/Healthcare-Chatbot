# Healthcare-Chatbot

The main objective of this project is to provide 24X7 access to patients to the medical world. Any person having disease starts panicking at first thinking about the seriousness of the disease and how much costly would the treatment be.

We here are trying to reduce the stress of the patients by letting them tell about their disease to the chatbot and in return the chatbot will predict the disease. It will also prescribe some basic medicines and also state various ways in which the person can prevent the disease from happening any further again. Some healthy foods that help to prevent the disease are also recommended by the bot.

Hence, with the use of this, one can easily diagnose their disease at an early stage and start treatment for the same at a very minimal or zero cost itself. One needs not to wait for the doctorâ€™s appointment to start treatment, thus saving a lot of money for consultation and also providing immediate relief from the disease.
